# DarknessUtilsPlus
```
This is the porting of the mod "DarknessUtils" to other versions of Minecraft to keep it up to date and to stay useful for AC players. Originally developed by Der_s but was ported and updated by ChloeAvesty.

This mod tries to implement QOL improvements for AC players during darkness fights. Currently the only feature is highlighting boss mobs during darkness fights.
